# HidePlayers

HidePlayers is a Minecraft Forge mod made for only rendering certain players in Hypixel Housing.

> This is a frankenstein of sorts, which combines code from the original version (1.1, as the latest commit didn't seem to work), code from https://github.com/supern64/HidePlayers, as well as my own little modifications (this is the very first thing I've ever done in Java)

## Usage

```
(/hp also works for all of these commands)

/hideplayers - Toggle rendering players.
/hideplayers mode [WHITELIST/BLACKLIST] - Set filtering mode.

/hideplayers add - Add a username to the whitelist/blacklist.
/hideplayers remove - Remove a username from the whitelist/blacklist.
/hideplayers list - Display the whitelist/blacklist.

```
